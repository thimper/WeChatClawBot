# Contributing to WeClawBot-ex

Before changing code, read these documents in order:

1. `moltApp/docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md`
2. `moltApp/docs/standards/AI-EXECUTION-BASELINE.md`
3. `moltApp/docs/standards/OPENCLAW-PLUGIN-COLLABORATION-BASELINE.md`
4. `openclaw-main/docs/molthuman/README.md`
5. `openclaw-main/docs/molthuman/weclawbot-fork-governance.md`

## Working rules

1. Treat upstream-derived runtime/protocol files as frozen by default.
2. Do not perform repository-wide renames without an approved plan.
3. Keep new product and management-console logic in first-party files whenever possible.
4. Use controlled patch files only when the change cannot be implemented outside the upstream-derived layer.

## Typical safe areas

1. `src/service/`
2. README and installation docs
3. Repository metadata
4. New adapter files with clear boundaries

## Before opening a change

1. List the exact files you plan to touch.
2. State which files are frozen, which are controlled patch files, and why.
3. Record the verification steps and rollback point.
